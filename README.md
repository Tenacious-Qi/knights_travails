## Knight's Travails

This project is an exercise in data structures as part of The Odin Project curriculum
Project 2 found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms)

A _Knight_ in chess can get to any other square on the board given enough moves.
The goal of this project is to write a function that, given a starting square and a destination square, returns the shortest path from start to destination, displaying each squares coordinates along the way.
This project will need to utilize graphs and the DFS and BFS algorithms of the previous [Binary Search Tree project](https://github.com/Tenacious-Qi/binary_search_tree).
